# Superhero Wallet

The Superhero Wallet is the way to store, send, and recive AE coins - around the world. The Superhero Wallet allows you to send and recieve value to URLs and content across Internet - instantly, and even to those do not have the wallet yet. Also, it empowers you to interact with smart contracts/decentralized applications on the aeternity blockchain.

Like any and all aspects of the aeternity ecosystem, it is completely decentralized, open source, and fully transparent - inviting everybody to come and take a look under the hood to see how it works! The AEstudio contract editor uses the Superhero Wallet to empower you to deploy smart contracts on the Aeternity Mainnet (or your own network of choice) and interact with them smoothly.

The Superhero Wallet is accessable on the platform itself, and as a [browser wallet](https://wallet.superhero.com/), but also as a browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superhero/mnhmmkepfddpifjkamaligfeemcbhdne?hl=en), [Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superhero/mnhmmkepfddpifjkamaligfeemcbhdne?hl=en), [Opera](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superhero/mnhmmkepfddpifjkamaligfeemcbhdne?hl=en), and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/superhero-wallet/) browsers as well.
