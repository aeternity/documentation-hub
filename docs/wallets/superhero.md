# Superhero Wallet

The SuperHero Wallet is a browser extension that allows you to send and recieve value to URLs and content across Internet.

Besides that, it empowers your browser to interact with smart contracts / decentralized applications on the Aeternity Blockchain. LLike any core component of Aeternity, it is open source, of course. The [AEstudio](developer-tools/aestudio.md) contract editor uses the Superhero Wallet to empower you to deploy smart contracts on the Aeternity Mainnet (or your own network of choice) and interact with them smoothly.
